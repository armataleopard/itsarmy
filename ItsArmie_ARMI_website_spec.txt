Project: ItsArmie ($ARMI) - Meme Coin Website Specification

Theme: Military / Tactical Ops
Style: Modern, gritty, masculine with humor. Think low-budget military cosplay mixed with explosive meme chaos.

Overview:
This website is the landing page for the meme coin "ItsArmie" ($ARMI), themed around over-the-top DIY military gear and tactical absurdity. It must feel like a chaotic yet professional tribute to every weird military meme in existence.

Core Structure:
1. Hero Section:
  - Fullscreen banner (banner.jpg)
  - Prominently display the coin name and ticker: “ItsArmie ($ARMI)” in large stencil-style font with glowing edges (like a digital HUD)
  - Explosion animation background with looping flames and smoke trails
  - CTA buttons:
    • [Twitter] → button linking to project's Twitter
    • [Buy on Pump.fun] → linking to token page on pump.fun
  - Logo (logo.jpg) fixed in top-left corner, slightly animated (pulse or rotation)

2. Meme Gallery Section:
  - Display all uploaded images (1.jpg–7.jpg)
  - Interactive hover animation: hover over image triggers explosion sound or shaking effect
  - Descriptions or fun callouts under images like “Field-tested Armor”, “Tactical Shampoo Loadout”, “Rocket-Bow Certified”

3. About the Coin:
  - Short meme-style storytelling:
    “In a world where deodorants are ammo and pans are grenades… one soldier rises. Armed with humor, chaos, and a ton of $ARMI, he's ready to take on the crypto battlefield.”
  - Details on $ARMI:
    • Network: Solana
    • Launchpad: Pump.fun
    • No VC, no roadmap, just vibes.

4. Tokenomics (in a meme format):
  - 100% for troops (no presale)
  - 0% taxes (soldiers eat free)
  - Liquidity: locked till WW5

5. Footer:
  - Social links again (Twitter / Pump.fun)
  - Background: subtle animated camouflage (camouflage.jpg)
  - Easter egg: clicking helmet logo (helmet.jpg) triggers small explosion gif and sound

Animations and Effects:
- Use scroll-based animations (e.g. fade in, zoom in)
- Click effects: small explosions
- Mouse hover glow on buttons
- Parallax background layers for depth

Fonts:
- Use military-style stencil fonts for headings
- Modern sans-serif for body text (Roboto or Inter)

Colors:
- Olive green, khaki, dark gray, desert yellow
- Accent with red warnings or explosion orange

Ensure the site looks clean and expensive despite the meme chaos — spacing and balance are important.
